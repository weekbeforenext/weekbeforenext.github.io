<h1>Preparing Your Children for a Move</h1>

<p>The following tips often help children adjust before, during, and after a family relocates.</p>
<ul>
<li>Include children in making plans for the move.  For example, take them house-hunting with you.</li>
<li>Help your children learn about the new area.</li>
<li>Through play-acting with dolls, boxes and a wagon, children can get a feeling of “moving”.</li>
<li>Let the children help decide how their new rooms are to be arranged and decorated.</li>
<li>Encourage children to exchange addresses and phone numbers with their friends.</li>
<li>Prepare a package for each child containing snacks, some clothing, and a few favorite toys for the move.</li>
<li>Take a “family break” as soon as the major unpacking is done.  Don’t try to do everything immediately upon arrival at your new home.</li>
<li>Parents should spend time after the move listening to each child about new schools and new friends.</li>
<li>Follow progress in new schools.  Accompanying your children to school the first few days may ease tension.</li>
<li>If your move involves suburban to rural, or vice versa, caution children about new situations they may face.</li>
</ul>
