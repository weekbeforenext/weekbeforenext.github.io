<h1>How to Pack Your Belongings</h1>

<p>The most important element in packing is organization.  Here are packing tips from the time you decide to move to the final execution of packing your belongings. </p> 
<ul>
<li>Make sure you have the essential packing supplies:  sturdy boxes and cartons, packing paper (unprinted newsprint) to wrap your belongings, heavy-duty tape, scissors, felt-tip markers to number and label each box.  <span class="greenBC">BoxCart</span> provides these items and many more discounted supplies, and the best part is they will be delivered right to your front door! Call us or click here to <a href="../../discounted_supplies/index.htm" target="_parent">order discounted supplies</a>.</li>

<li>Use clean boxes designed for moving.  Grocery or liquor store boxes are not always clean and may not withstand the weight of the items you will be putting in them.  Also, their odd sizes tend to make loading more difficult.</li>

<li>Use only unprinted newsprint paper to wrap items.  Regular newspaper ink can rub off and ruin your possessions.</li>

<li>Pack on a room-by-room basis and do one area of the room at a time.  It is best not to mix items from different rooms in one box.  To prevent small items from being lost or mistakenly thrown out with the packing paper, wrap small items in brightly-colored tissue paper before placing them in the box.</li>

<li>Small boxes should be used for small, heavy items such as books, records, canned goods, and small appliances.  Medium general purpose boxes can hold pots and pans, other kitchen utensils, toys, and other items of medium size and weight.  Large and X-Large general purpose boxes are good for large but lightweight items such as bedding, stuffed toys, pillows, wicker baskets and silk plants.</li>

<li>Assemble boxes and tape all seams securely with sturdy packing tape.</li>

<li>Put crumpled packing paper in the bottom of each carton before loading contents, as well as a layer on top of your goods before sealing the box.  Fill boxes completely, stuffing open areas with packing paper, to prevent collapsing when stacked.</li>

<li>Wrap all items in unprinted newsprint or tissue before placing into the box to reduce any chance of being damaged.</li>

<li>Put large and heavy items in boxes first, followed by smaller and lighter items that can be used as filler.</li>

<li>For furniture and lamps that must be dismantled, put the hardware in a plastic bag, and tape the bag directly to the piece of furniture.  That way, you’ll know what goes with what.  Even better, take a picture of what you are about to take apart, so you can put it back together at the end of your move.  </li>

<li>Securely tape the top seams of the box to keep out dust and other debris.</li>

<li>Clearly label each box (on sides and top) with a general description of contents, as well as to which room the box should go. </li> 

<li>Mark boxes with breakable items as “FRAGILE”.  Pack breakables over the box you’re putting them in.  This way, if you happen to drop an item, it will land on some packing material, therefore reducing the chance that it will break.</li>

<li>Never pack hazardous materials including flammables such as paint, varnish, and thinners; gasoline; kerosene and oil; bottled gas; aerosol cans; nail polish and remover; ammunition and explosives; corrosives; and cleaning fluids and detergents.</li>

<li>Drain fuel from mowers and other machinery, and discard partly used cans of oil, paint, thinner, or other substances that might leak.</li>

<li>Third-party servicing will likely be needed before moving such items as hot tubs, large-screen TV’s, and some exercise equipment.  Check your owner’s manuals for CD/DVD players, computers etc. for steps to take to protect items from damage during transit.</li>

<li>You should personally transport irreplaceable photos, financial papers and assets (bank checks, insurance policies, stock certificates, etc.), legal documents (wills, passports, etc.), valuables (jewelry, coin and stamp collections, etc.), and medical and family history records.</li>
