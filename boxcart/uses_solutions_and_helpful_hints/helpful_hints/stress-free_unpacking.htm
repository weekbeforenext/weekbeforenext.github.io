<h1>Stree-Free Unpacking</h1>

<p>Finally, your move is complete, and now it’s time to unpack.  It’s a daunting task, but here are some helpful hints to make the unpacking process easier.  One essential thing to remember – You don’t have to unpack everything in one day or even in one week. Take your time and maybe you’ll even be able to enjoy the process as another step along a new adventure!</p>

<h2>First Things First…The Essentials</h2>
<ul>
<li>Set up basic kitchen items like paper plates and cups, drinks and snacks.  Also, make sure to unpack and set up at least one bathroom with proper toiletries.</li>
<li>Before you fully unpack, take the time to clean each room and wipe out drawers.</li>
<li>Create an “unwind” zone where you can relax at the end of the day, without having to climb over boxes, etc.  Set up the TV or stereo, bring in some furniture and lamps.  It may not be permanent, but it should help you feel a little more at home.</li>
<li>Unpack your bedding and make up the beds as soon as they’re in place, so they’re ready when you’re ready to fall into them at the end of the day!  Also, if you have to dress for work or a special occasion the day after your move, make sure you have an outfit ready to wear.</li>
<li>If you have an extra room you won’t be using right away, put non-essential boxes in there until you’re ready to unpack them.</li>
</ul>

<h2>The Kitchen</h2>
<ul>
<li>Unpack your essential china and cookware into the dishwasher and run it, so you have clean dishes to prepare meals or snacks right away. </li> 
<li>Once the kitchen is set up enough to function, it can become a haven where everyone can meet and take a break from the chaos in the other rooms.</li>
<li>Resist the urge to unpack everything that belongs in the kitchen right away.  Instead, start with the basics and leave the less-frequently-used items in boxes until you decide your room and storage arrangements.</li>
</ul>

<h2>The Bedroom</h2>
<ul>
<li>Arrange the main pieces of furniture and transfer your clothes to drawers and shelves.  If at all possible, take the time to organize your belongings as you go, so you don’t have to straighten them out later!</li>
</ul>

<h2>The Living Room</h2>
<ul>
<li>It’s a good idea to make a sketch of the room, and how you want the furniture laid out.  It’s easier to move furniture around on paper than it is to lift and move the actual couches around the room.</li>
<li>Arrange your large pieces of furniture and set up your electronics near available outlets.  Remember, if the cable still needs to be set up, it’s a good idea to keep the TV cabinet away from the wall enough that you do not have to move it again when the cable company arrives.</li>
</ul>

<h2>All Other Rooms</h2>
<ul>
<li>Your lifestyle should dictate what rooms are organized next.  When it’s time to set up the garage, consider installing shelves and wall hooks so you can arrange tools, shovels, and rakes as you unpack.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Take it Easy!</h2>
<ul>
<li>Don’t let unpacking stress you out.  Take your time and remember…what matters most is that you’ve made it into your new home.  Step by step, the job will get done!</li>
</ul>
