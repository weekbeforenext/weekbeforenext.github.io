<h1>Showing Your Home</h1>

<p>It’s not as easy as it may seem.  Potential buyers have a tendency to look in every nook and cranny.  They will look in your closets, your cabinets, and under your beds.  Follow these simple guidelines to make showing your home a success!</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Make a Good First Impression</strong>.  Have your lawn freshly cut and the landscaping neatly manicured.</li>
<li><strong>Eliminate Distractions</strong>.  Keep the entryway clear of any umbrellas or shoes.  Try adding flowers for a light, airy look.</li>  
<li><strong>Less is More</strong>.  Make your house the neatest it’s ever been.  Clear countertops of clutter, including small appliances.  Re-shelve books and display only minimal knick-knacks, so the potential buyers can visualize their own belongings in these spaces.</li>
<li><strong>Make Space</strong>.  Showing plenty of floor and wall space will make your home feel bigger.</li>
<li><strong>Spic and span</strong>.  Nobody likes a dirty house.  Clean your house from top to bottom.  It may be worthwhile to hire a cleaning crew, so you can focus your attention on other parts of the moving process.</li>
<li><strong>Be a Show Off</strong>.  Highlight every feature of your house without shame – porches, alcoves, garages, and other storage areas are good selling features, but make sure these spaces are neat and clean.</li>
<li><strong>Closet Case</strong>.  Make closets look organized and spacious.  Keep as many belongings off the floor as possible, and make sure they are neatly vacuumed.</li>  
<li><strong>Lighten Up</strong>.  Light gives the appearance of space.  Open curtains and clean skylights.  Remove anything that blocks the windows, and make sure all light fixtures have new, brightly burning bulbs.</li>
</ol>
