<h1>Countdown to Moving Day</h1>

<p>As we all know, moving is one of the most stressful times in a person's life.  We at <span class="greenBC">BoxCart</span> want to make sure your move is as worry-free as possible.  Here are some tips to making your move a success.</p>
<p>First you'll need to determine how you are going to make your move. If you're moving locally within the DC Metro area, let <span class="greenBC">BoxCart</span> help! We can deliver containers to your current residence, you load them up, and we'll move them directly to your new local destination. </p>
<p>If you don't want to deal with the whole move yourself and you hire movers, don't forget about the need to unclutter your home before you put it on the market. Call <span class="greenBC">BoxCart</span>, and we'll deliver containers to your home. Pack up all your precious &quot;clutter&quot; and we'll store it for you. When you move into your new local home, we'll deliver the containers right to your new doorstep, or you could even have the movers come to our facility and pick up your goods on their way to your new home. </p>
<h2>One Month Before Your Move</h2>

<ul>
<li>Go through your belongings (especially closets, the attic, and garage) to determine what you want to keep, and more importantly, what you can get rid of.  If you have enough time, you may want to think about a garage sale or donating items to a local charity.  When donating goods, don't forget to keep the receipt for a possible tax deduction!</li>
<li>Check with your insurance company about coverage for your possessions while in transit or in storage.  <span class="greenBC">BoxCart</span> offers insurance coverage for customers while goods are stored at our facility.  Ask a <span class="greenBC">BoxCart</span> representative for more information.</li>
<li>If you are doing your own packing, acquire all appropriate boxes and packing
  supplies. <span class="greenBC">BoxCart</span> offers all the discounted packing supplies you may need - boxes,
  paper, tape, bubble-wrap, etc. - and we deliver right to your front door! 
  Call us or click here to <a href="../../discounted_supplies/index.htm" target="_parent">order discounted supplies</a>.</li>  
<li>Arrange  cleaning for furniture, carpets, and drapes, especially if any of these goods are going to be put into storage.</li>
<li>Begin to pack items you won't need before the move.  For example, out-of-season clothes, seasonal decorations, and books/movies.</li>  
<li>Start a file folder for all important documents to keep with you during your move.  For example, financial documents, bank checks, insurance information, most recent tax return, vehicle titles, social security cards, contact information for moving/storage and utility companies.</li>
<li>Put together a box for all valuables you will want to transport yourself.  For example, irreplaceable photos, jewelry, coin and stamp collections.</li>
<li>Start a file folder to keep track of all your moving expenses.  Some expenses may be tax deductible.  Visit the <a href="http://www.irs.gov" target="blank">IRS
    website</a> to find the most recent moving expense information.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Two Weeks Before Your Move</h2>

<ul>
<li>Continue to pack your belongings.  Make sure to clearly label what is in each box and what room that box will go to in new residence.</li>
<li>If moving out of and/or into a building with an elevator, make arrangements to have exclusive use of the elevator for the duration of your move.</li>  
<li>Arrange to have utilities (gas, electric, phone, cable, water, trash removal etc.) disconnected in your present home a day AFTER you move out and connected at your new home a day BEFORE you move in.</li>
<li>Fill out change-of-address cards with the Post Office.  Give your new address to anyone that might need it - insurance agents, credit card companies, magazine subscriptions, friends, relatives, etc.</li>
<li>Make any necessary arrangements for transporting pets and plants.</li>
</ul>

<h2>One Week Before Your Move</h2>

<ul>
<li>Pack a "survival kit" - Identify what each person in your household must have while you're in the midst of moving.  For example, special foods, prescription drugs, etc.  Other items may include:
<ul>
<li>Keys to your new home; phone number, address and directions to your new home; the file with all your important documents</li>
<li>Basic tools:  hammer, screwdriver, nails, masking tape, tape measure, flashlight, light bulbs, pocket knife, trash bags</li>
<li>Bathroom essentials: towels, soap, toilet paper, personal items</li>
<li>Kitchen essentials: snacks, paper plates, cups, utensils</li>
<li>Miscellaneous: eyeglasses, address book, checkbook, phone, clock, change of clothes</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Place all items not to be moved in a separate area, room, or closet and clearly label "DO NOT MOVE".</li>
<li>Transfer any prescriptions to new pharmacy.</li>
<li>Transfer (or cancel) newspaper delivery to your new address.</li>
<li>Use up any perishable food items and defrost all refrigerators and freezers.</li>
<li>Dispose of all items too dangerous to move, including flammables such as paint, varnish, and thinners; gasoline; kerosene and oil; bottled gas; aerosol cans; nail polish and remover; ammunition and explosives; corrosives; and cleaning fluids and detergents.</li>
</ul>

<h2>MOVING DAY!!</h2>
<ul>
<li>If you have hired a professional mover, do a walk-through with the movers to advise them of what they will and will not be moving.</li>
<li>Make a thorough inspection of your old residence to make sure nothing has been left behind.</li>
<li>Make sure someone will be at your new residence to work with your movers (whether they're professionals or simply obliging friends), directing them where to put each item as it is brought in.</li>
</ul>
